# splatattack
A sample game for GameFrame. The object is to squash as many bugs as you can in the allocated time. The game makes use of multiple rooms, timers, sounds and mouse click events.  This is a good game to review, modify and extend, to become familiar with room progression and using timers.

Splat Attack has now been updated to store scores in an Sqlite database and show top 5 scores at the end of the game.
This game can be used as a reference for connecting to and querying an Sqlite database in GameFrame
